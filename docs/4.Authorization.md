# Authorization
ZfcAdmin allows authorization via [BjyAuthorize](https://github.com/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize) or [ZfcRbac](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcRbac). Configuration for both modules is provided to easily configure ZfcAdmin. Authorization enables you to restrict access to `/admin` and every other page under ZfcAdmin.

## BjyAuthorize authorization
BjyAuthorize works with `Zend\Permission\Acl` as access restriction component. The BjyAuthorize module combines `Zend\Permission\Acl` with the standard user module [ZfcUser](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser). To enable access restriction with BjyAuthorize, install the module and enable it in your `application.config.php`.

Furthermore, ZfcAdmin has a `zfcadmin.global.php` file in the [config](../config/) directory. Copy this file over to your `config/autoload` directory. It directly provides BjyAuthorize configuration to restrict access to users for the `/admin` route. Only users in the "admin" group are allowed to access ZfcAdmin's pages.

Instructions for further configuration of BjyAuthorize are provided in the [repository of BjyAuthorize](https://github.com/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize).

## ZfcRbac authorization
ZfcRbac works with `Zend\Permission\Rbac` as access restriction component. The ZfcRbac module combines `Zend\Permission\Rbac` with the standard user module [ZfcUser](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser). To enable access restriction with ZfcRbac, install the module and enable it in your `application.config.php`.

Furthermore, ZfcAdmin has a `zfcadmin.global.php` file in the [config](../config/) directory. Copy this file over to your `config/autoload` directory. It directly provides ZfcRbac configuration to restrict access to users for the `/admin` route. Only users in the "admin" group are allowed to access ZfcAdmin's pages.

Instructions for further configuration of ZfcRbac are provided in the [repository of ZfcRbac](https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcRbac).

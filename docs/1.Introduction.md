# Introduction
ZfcAdmin is a low-level module that helps Zend Framework 2 developers to create an admin interface. The module allows to have a uniform layout, navigation structure and routing scheme. You can create controllers routed as a child of ZfcAdmin, so you can easily change the (root) url, access control and other properties. The navigation is also flexible, to allow you having a structure built of pages in the admin interface with menus, breadcrumbs and other links.

Every part of ZfcAdmin is customizable. In the pages listed below futher configuration options are explained. This documentation consists of the following pages:
